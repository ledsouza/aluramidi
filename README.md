## **Short Description**

Alura Midi is an engaging web application that brings the fun of playing a musical keyboard to your browser. With a visually appealing and interactive interface, users can click or tap on the keys to produce corresponding sounds, making it a great tool for musical exploration and creativity.

## **Technologies**

*   **HTML5:** Structures the layout and content of the keyboard interface.
*   **CSS3:** Styles the appearance of the keyboard, keys, and other visual elements.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers the dynamic interactivity of the keys, including sound playback, visual feedback, and keyboard event handling.

## **Functionalities**

1.  **Interactive Keyboard Display:**
    *   Presents a realistic keyboard layout with individual keys.
    *   Each key is visually distinct and labeled with its corresponding note.

2.  **Key Press Interaction:**
    *   Users can click or tap on keys to trigger sound playback.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., key highlighting) indicates the active key.

3.  **Sound Playback:**
    *   High-quality audio samples for each key/note.
    *   Sounds are triggered instantly upon key press.


## **Project Goals & Learning Objectives**

This project, completed as part of an Alura course, focuses on:

*   **Dynamic Web Interaction:** Applying JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
*   **Event Handling:** Implementing event listeners to capture user input (key presses) and trigger appropriate actions (sound playback).
*   **DOM Manipulation:**  Using JavaScript to modify the visual appearance of elements in response to user interactions.
*   **Audio Integration:**  Incorporating audio elements and controlling sound playback within a web application.
